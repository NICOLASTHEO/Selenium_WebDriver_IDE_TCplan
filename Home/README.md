# NEW PRICING TOOL VISTEX PROJECT - NPTV

This is an automation project  for the Aloware SOFTWARE, it's with [Robot Framework](https://robotframework.org/), aims to implement the project pattern to Page Objects and test cases written with [Gherkin](https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/) or [Procedural], at the beginning of each test there is a information in the Documentation about the methodology to be used.

Robot's libraries encapsulate the most used testing tools on the market. To run the GUI tests on Web systems, the selenium library is been used [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/). To run GUI tests on mobile systems, the [Appium](https://appium.io), at this first moment, by decision of the managers, no tests or Mobile validations will be carried out. For API tests, the library of [Python requests](https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests), which provides all the necessary tools for HTTP requests, both for REST and SOAP.

## Project Configuration

Robot framework is built with Python, so it is necessary that you have the latest version of this technology installed on your machine and it can be found through the [Python official page](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

The installation of the framework and its auxiliary libraries is done through `pip`, Python's native library manager. Proceed with the command below:

```sh
$ pip install robotframework
```

And check if the installation went correctly:

```sh
$ robot --version
```

Next, install the libraries that will be used in the project using the `pip` command:
for example:
- [SeleniumLibrary](https://github.com/robotframework/SeleniumLibrary/)

# Before you run :#

## Web Test Setup ##
The tests may be run in two different modes, configured in separate files:

# How to copy this project into yours #
I'll let two ways, a zip file will besend by emmail; and in the Theo's Github, url:  https://github.com/NICOLASTHEO  


# Project Execution #
## How to run ##

To execute the scripts, execute the command below via terminal being inside the project's root directory, and passing as arguments the directory where the reports and execution logs will be inserted and the directory where the test scripts are.

```sh
$ robot -d ..\reports  home_tests.robot

And for CI (Gitlab or Jenkins)
$ robot -i home -d ..\reports -v BROWSER:headlesschrome home_tests.robot
```

## execution parameters ## 

## -tag (required) ##
BDD Tag to run testdriverPath

## -env (default: -env=dev) ##
local, dev, prd

## -browser (default: -browser=chrome ) ##
chrome, firefox, edge

## config (default: -config=support/config ) ##
Config directory path

## -driverPath ##
Path to the local browser driver

# Design standards and best practices #

To work on a Robot Framework project it is strongly recommended that the programmer constantly read its [documentaÃ§Ã£o](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/#user-guide),  and be aware of the [Python design standards](https://python-patterns.guide/),  technology used to implement the framework.

The purpose of this approach is to build simple and readable scripts. For those who don't know the project easily understand it.

## Libraries used in the Project

In this project we are using the libraries below:
EXAMPLES:

[seleniumlibrary]:
pip install robotframework-seleniumlibrary
